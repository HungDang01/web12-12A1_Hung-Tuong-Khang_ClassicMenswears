        <h1>What is classic menswear?</h1>
            <p>Classic menswear is not fashion but rather style. It is not about advance knowledge of clothes
                nor the deep meaning of personality or even philosophy behind outfits. It is just a way of dressing that embraces
                the traditional, conservative garments or clothing philosophies. In general, classic menswear is respecting and using
                what's worked and stood through the test of time, making it a style - a practical choice of dressing.

                <h2 class="Sub1">1. Vintage menswear</h2>
                <p class="Content">This is a style that focuses on going truly back in time (Usually during the 30s and 40s) where 
                    it fully coppies every traits of clothing from the past with little to no alterarions. Iconic features of this style are braces, full-cut suits, detachable
                    collars, flamboyant and gigantic ties, reversed pleates, etc. This style is rather hard to go for since
                    it carries too much traits from the past which resulted in a customey look if not carefully styled.

                <p class="Content">This style originated from the Ivy league universities of USA during the 50s and 60s. It is a mixture of both vintage and
                    mordern of its time. The garments are truly vintage since students inherited their clothes from their parents. Yet they styled it in an
                    athletic and laid-back way. Its dinstict features are bold sweaters - often wrapped around one's neck or worn over shirt and ties, chinos,
                    tweed sport coats, oxford p-down shirts, bow-ties, etc.

                <h2 class="Sub3">3. British Countryside</h2>
                <p class="Content">As the name suggests, this is a form of dressing that is heavily inspired by how British dress in the countryside.
                    It is mostly based on the image of Britain aristocrats and how they dress in the countryside, from the country clubs to even outdoor
                    activities. We often see it as hunting jackets, waxed jackets, heavy tweed sport coats, hacking jackets, etc. The aesthetic is about
                    layering multiple textures, looking rough and beaten up.

        <h1 class="Philosophy">How to dress classic?</h1>
        <p>     It is plain to see that in order to dress classically, one needs to buy quality and classic clothes without falling into
            trends or athletic garments. Yet to buy the most accurate garments need more than knowing the type of clothing. The fit
            must be right without being too slim nor too baggy so go for regular, or best of all, full cut. The material is also critical
            so go for natural fibers and choose appropriate fabric for the weather. Pay attention closely to the trousers and the shoes as
            they are foundational and are often made wrong by modern fashion companies. The shoe's sole got to be small, not chunky and got
            to have a small heel. It is best that the sole is made out of wood and leather but rubber is still acceptable. The trousers must
            be high rise with no exception as it follows the 2:3 golden ratio rule.</p>
        <img src="Assets/Untitled design (4).png">
        <p>
                Other than the design, the philosophy of how to style it is equally important. The best advice to keep in mind is you must
            be natural to your clothes and truly live in them. No amount of layering or propotion-playing is going to be enough to convince
            people or yourself that you are stylish unless you are authentic to your clothes, and the only way to do that is to live within
            it. So that is where practicallity shines since it helps you to comfortably and ultilitary wear your clothes through the day. We
            can see that the best menswear icons in this world does not need crazy styling or combinations. Steve Mcqueen is often seen in
            his T-shirts and jeans, Giorgio Armani in his unironed shirt or the Duke of Windsor in his Drape Cut suits that are roomy and
            much more laid-back than other cuts at the time.
